            <p>
                As organizations face increasingly complex authorization challenges with distributed architectures, cloud services, and diverse user bases, choosing the right access control model is crucial. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), and eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) represent three distinct approaches to solving these challenges, each with unique strengths and trade-offs for different enterprise scenarios.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                While PBAC emphasizes centralized policy management and enforcement across resources, ReBAC reflects real-world relationships between entities, offering flexibility in dynamic and social environments. XACML provides standards-based control with maximum customization capabilities. Understanding these differences is key to selecting the right model for your organization's specific needs.

            <h2>Key Differences Explained</h2>
            
            <div class="difference-point">
                <h3>PBAC vs ReBAC: Policy-Driven vs Relationship-Driven</h3>
                <p><strong>PBAC:</strong> Focuses on predefined policies that govern access based on roles, attributes, and environmental factors. It centralizes policy management, allowing fine-grained or coarse-grained control across applications and resources. Ideal for ensuring consistency, compliance, and visibility across the enterprise.</p>
                <p><strong>ReBAC:</strong> Centers around relationships between users, resources, and contextual entities. Access is granted based on the nature of these relationships rather than just user attributes or roles. Well-suited for environments where relationships like supervisor-employee or peer collaboration dictate resource access. ReBAC reflects real-world relationships, offering more flexibility in dynamic and social environments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-point">
                <h3>PBAC vs XACML: Modern Simplicity vs Standards Compliance</h3>
                <p><strong>PBAC:</strong> Designed for simplicity and usability with intuitive policy definitions managed through centralized interfaces. Makes access control accessible to business users and security teams without specialized expertise.</p>
                <p><strong>XACML:</strong> Provides standards-based flexibility through XML, offering maximum customization at the cost of complexity. Requires XML expertise and can be challenging to manage at scale without additional abstraction layers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="difference-point">
                <h3>Policy Management Philosophy</h3>
                <p><strong>PBAC:</strong> Centralized management via graphical interfaces and APIs. Simplifies the entire policy lifecycle with built-in simulation and analysis tools.</p>
                <p><strong>ReBAC:</strong> Manages relationships in graph databases, requiring understanding of entity connections and graph traversal. Policies mirror real-world relationships, making them intuitive for collaboration scenarios.</p>
                <p><strong>XACML:</strong> Uses decentralized XML files which can lead to fragmented administration, especially challenging in distributed environments.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="difference-point">
                <h3>Integration and Deployment</h3>
                <p><strong>PBAC:</strong> Offers extensive out-of-the-box integrations with enterprise applications, APIs, and cloud services. Supports modern architectures natively.</p>
                <p><strong>ReBAC:</strong> Best integrated within applications that naturally model relationships, requiring custom implementation for each use case. Excels in systems with complex relationship structures where traditional models fall short.</p>
                <p><strong>XACML:</strong> Requires significant custom integration effort, particularly in modern cloud-native environments. Better suited for XML-based legacy systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="difference-point">
                <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>
                <p><strong>PBAC:</strong> Optimized for real-time, dynamic access decisions in cloud and distributed environments with minimal latency.</p>
                <p><strong>ReBAC:</strong> Performance depends on graph depth and complexity; efficient for relationship traversal but can slow with deep hierarchies.</p>
                <p><strong>XACML:</strong> XML parsing and complex policy evaluation can introduce performance overhead, especially in high-throughput scenarios.</p>
